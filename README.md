# photoalbum-api
Study Project. API for uploading images and text. Node JS + Typescript.
The focus in this project is on implementing simple functional programming techiques; more precisely, function composition and abstraction through partial applications of functions.
An attempt was made at finding a proper full typing of pipe and compose (which rejects inconsistent sequences of functions) for Typescript 3. The typing succeeds at real time evaluation but fails on compilation. The next step will be to try Typescript 4 beta. 
The project was initially based on Fazt code's https://github.com/FaztTech/photo-gallery-api
